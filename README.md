# ctwm-configurations

Here my developed .ctwmrc.
You can use it by copying it into you home dir, as  ~/.ctwmrc 

Here the NetBSD 3.5.2.c compiled on Raspberry with NetBSD 8.1
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spartrekus/ctwm-configurations/master/ctwm-3.5.2c-compiled-netbsd.png)

Here the tarball 3.5.2.c.

tar xvpfz to uncompress the tarball,
then  xmkmf, followed by make. 

It will give a ctwm, compiled using Xlib.h on a regular NetBSD clean installation. 
You only need a running startx / Xorg.


In any case, there is a good repos:
